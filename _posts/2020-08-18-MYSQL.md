## MYSQL

I recently signed up for Database courses at the LosRios Community Colleges, CISA 320 and CISA321.
In prep, I took the coursera course.

[Database Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql/lecture/wev1k/how-to-use-your-jupyter-account "Database Course")

This course used the following technology stack:

1. **ERDPlus** - this was used to draw Entity relationship diagrams. 
[ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/standalone "ERDPlus")

2. **MySQL** - as the backend database.
[MYSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql "mysql")

3. **Jupyter notebooks** - as the interface to interact with the database.
[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html "JUPYTER NOTEBOOK")


**NOTE:**

Just for fun, I also looked up PhpMyadmin as an interface to interact with the database. Both Jupyter and phpmyadmin are interfaces to interact with the databases. Which one you pick just depends on your personal preference.

Installing all the above stack seemed like a pain, thatâ€™s where I ran into Docker. Docker is a container tool to ease installation and make installation of applications easily repeatable and portable across LINUX, MAC, WINDOWS.

I followed the steps from [DG Dominick Gendill](https://www.dgendill.com/posts/programming/2016-07-03-docker-mysql-notes.html  "DG Dominick Gendill") to help me figure out how to run MySQL and PhpMyAdmin locally with Docker.
