## MYSQL

I recently signed up for Database courses at the LosRios Community Colleges, CISA 320 and CISA321.
In prep, I took the coursera course.

[Database Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql/lecture/wev1k/how-to-use-your-jupyter-account "Database Course"

This course used the following technology stack:

1. **ERDPlus** - this was used to draw Entity relationship diagrams.

2. **MySQL** - as the backend database.
[MYSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql "mysql")

3. **Jupyter notebooks** - as the interface to interact with the database.
