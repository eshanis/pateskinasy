## MYSQL

I recently signed up for Database courses at the LosRios Community Colleges, CISA 320 and CISA321.
In prep, I took the coursera course.

[Database Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql/lecture/wev1k/how-to-use-your-jupyter-account "Database Course")

This course used the following technology stack:

1. **ERDPlus** - this was used to draw Entity relationship diagrams. 
[ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/standalone "ERDPlus")

2. **MySQL** - as the backend database.
[MYSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql "mysql")

3. **Jupyter notebooks** - as the interface to interact with the database.
[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html "JUPYTER NOTEBOOK")


**NOTE:**

Just for fun, I also looked up PhpMyadmin as an interface to interact with the database. Both Jupyter and phpmyadmin are interfaces to interact with the databases. Which one you pick just depends on your personal preference. 
[phpmyadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/ "phpmyadmin interface")


Installing all the above stack seemed like a pain, thatâ€™s where I ran into Docker. Docker is a container tool to ease installation and make installation of applications easily repeatable and portable across LINUX, MAC, WINDOWS.
[DOCKER container](https://www.docker.com/ "docker container")
I followed the steps from [DG Dominick Gendill](https://www.dgendill.com/posts/programming/2016-07-03-docker-mysql-notes.html  "DG Dominick Gendill") to help me figure out how to run MySQL and PhpMyAdmin locally with Docker.

## SET UP MYSQL & PHPMYADMIN

Before you begin set up make sure docker is installed.
The reason for creating the docker network is so that the containers can talk to each other.
To launch the Docker containers open a terminal and follow the commands listed below. The terminals I used was Window's Powershell and MINGW64:/

1. The first command is to create the mysql network [mysql network](docker network create mysql-network "mysql network")
``docker network create mysql-network``

2. The next command is to run mysql in the docker container 
[run mysql](docker run --name eshani-mysql --net=mysql-network -p3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:latest "run mysql")

``docker run --name eshani-mysql --net=mysql-network -p3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:latest``

The above command is read as running the latest version of mysql on docker over mysql network named eshani opening it to the outside world using port 3306, using the user name root and password as password.
