excerpt: Read about tools and courses that help to set up your website
---
When I started learning about how to set up websites on various platforms, HTML, Linux and started taking courses, I was extremely confused and didn't know where to start. I am completely new to the tech side of things and everyday was kind of a do over of me until I started getting a hang of things. I started writing about "how to" and "where to go" so I could track what I was doing and maybe help someone else in the same boat. This blog is a summary of things I found useful. 


**WEBHOSTING OPTIONS**

There are many webserver options. The ones I explored and used were aws, github and 000webhost. I have written below my experiences in using these options.

**a.**  [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) - **Amazon Web Services** 
<div>
        This involved many steps and I had to pay for this service after my free account for a year was used up.
        For details read my [blog](https://blog.eshani.ml/website-on-AWS/) 
</div>

<br>
**b.**  **Github** 
<div>
        This is another webhosting option I explored because it did not require me to write complicated code.
        I created the [github pages](https://blog.eshani.ml/) website as my tech blog on Github pages. You can find
        the code to my website [here](https://github.com/eshanis/eshanis.github.io). You can find details on how to
        set up [here](https://blog.eshani.ml/github-website/) I got my free domain on [freenom]
        (https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php?action=domains) 
</div>

         and linked it to my github pages webaddress which is [https://eshanis.github.io](https://eshanis.github.io)

 To create my githubpages blog website, I used a **tool** called [prose.io](https://prose.io/#eshanis)

    NOTE: One of the quirks of prose is sometimes you have to manually set published: true in the meta data section

**c.**  **000webhost** 
<div>  
 To create my main website I used [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/) because
         they have a free account for a basic website. I also linked my 000webhost domain to my eshanis.ml domain
         using cname on **freenom**
</div>

   **NOTE:** Don't forget to also connect your domain on the [000webhost website](https://www.000webhost.com/).

**COURSES**

I am signed up for an [associates degree at Los Rios College](https://www.scc.losrios.edu/academics/programs-and-majors/computer-information-science)

I also took some online courses which helped me. I followed a course on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome) and 
the [course lectures](https://github.com/eshanis/fullstack-course4) and code can be found on github

Another online course that was interactive and helped me was [rithm school](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/html-css-fundamentals) 
The Code and lectures for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/eshanis/html_css_basics_solutions)
