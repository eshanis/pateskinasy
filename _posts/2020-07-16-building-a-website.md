There are various ways to build a website. It seemed very daunting to me and I didn't know where to begin so I started exploring different ways to see what worked for me.  I am still learning and exploring. A few ways to build a website are listed below.

1. I used the Jekyll framework because it gives me the option to directly host the website on the github pages. I used the jekyll now and template from [eshnil2000](https://github.com/eshnil2000/mm-github-pages-starter), which makes it easier to show pictures in the list of posts. More details can be found [here.](https://blog.eshani.ml/github-website/).

2. There are many templates available to use so you don't have to build the website from scracth. I experimented with [Styleshout](https://www.styleshout.com/) for easy to use templates. I used the [typewrite template](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/) which I customized for my main website [eshani.ml](http://www.eshani.ml/). Details on how to do this can be found [here](https://blog.eshani.ml/building-website-using-typerite-template/)

3. Another option is to use [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). This is the quickest option to make modifications and customizations. This did not give me the opportunity to learn hands on which is why I did not pick to go this way. 

4. You can start building a website from scratch. This means creating HTML, CSS and Java Script. This is a very painful process but a great way to learn. This one I have not yet tried.
