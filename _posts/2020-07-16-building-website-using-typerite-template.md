Hello!
When I started, I was so overwhelmed with all the options out there and trying to figure out how to host a website without spending a ton of money, it took me awhile to get here. Hope this blog makes it easier for you to build your website. This blog is a step by step guide to building a website using [typerite template](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/).

**Step 1.** 
  
I downloaded the files from [typerite](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/typerite/) onto my computer as a zipped folder. See image below for the files included in the zipped folder.

**Step 2.** 
 
I used [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) to edit the files. When you open the files using Brackets, you need to unzip the folder. I used Brackets for couple of different reasons
<div>
-it gives me a live preview of the changes I make right next to the editor. To got to live preview, click on the drop down menu for file and select "live preview".

<div>
-it lets me edit CSS files in the Index folder using the quck edit option when you right click on the down arrow.

**Step 3.** 

I used freenom to register my domain name. For details click [here](https://blog.eshani.ml/tools-and-courses-to-set_up-website-edit/ "Domain_name")

**Step 4.** 

Once the editing is completed using Bracket, I uploaded the website to [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/). For information on how to [click here](https://blog.eshani.ml/tools-and-courses-to-set_up-website-edit/ "Cname")

When uploading to 000webhost, make sure to unzip the files.

The files need to be uploaded in the public.html folder
